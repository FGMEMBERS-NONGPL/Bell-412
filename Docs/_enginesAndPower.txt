1. At engine start (switche on), dcbat down from nominal 26V to 18V)
2. after 1:30, moving collective thrust to max then tacho goes up to 80-90

starting engine 1 with collect. thrust at 0, 
then start engine 1, then up collect thrust to 50%,
then tacho eng.1 up to 90 in 10 sec., follow tacho and increase collect.
thrust for eng 1 to 100%

* Collective
- position down (FG UP), blade 0°
- position up (fg down), blade 45°
At startup, pos blade at 20°
- FG :
	/controls/engines/engine/throttle:
	from 1 down (fg up)
	to   0 up   (fg down)

* Inverter
Q11. What is the function of static inverter? And to which BUS will it supply?
A11. A Static Inverter transforms DC Power from Battery 1 in to One KVA of
single phase 115 Volt 400 Hertz AC power, which is then supplied to part of
the AC ESS BUS. When the aircraft speed is above 50 knots, the inverter is
automatically activated, if nothing but the batteries are supplying electrical
power to the aircraft, regardless of the BAT 1 and BAT 2 P/b positions.
