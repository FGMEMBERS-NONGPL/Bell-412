There¿s no such thing as mission impossible for the 412.
Better by degrees, whether Fahrenheit or Celsius.
Proven from the Arctic Circle to the Arabian Gulf, the 412 can operate in conditions that would cripple most other aircraft. It offers the highest dispatch reliability of any twinengine and is designed with rupture resistant fuel cells, energy-absorbing crew seats and a resilient fuselage. And most important, confidence in knowing that the helicopter that got you in can also get you out.
