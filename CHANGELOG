29/06/16 -- v0.1 (R30)
- initial release

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16/11/16 -- v0.2 (R32)
* COMPAT: 
- test with FG2016.3.1 ( ALS/Rembrandt) : OK
- ALS/Rembrandt lightning OK	

* FDM: ballast/weight/rotor change, CoG is near to be the real one. Flying AOA at 0°
  aircraft is more stable at 0Kt (stationary) ; notice that collectiv behaviour has changed too.

* MODEL:
- airspeed indicator (needle) rotate well now and is well calibrated.
  (NOTE: here the yellow part range is from 0-20 kt while it is 0-30 kt for the real Bell ;
   we keep this fake range in order to be more accurate at low speed
   - in the reality, the 0-30 kt range is not accurate at all, ... so we don't care)
- main pilot instruments with 'console-spot' lightning is pretty done now.
- engine panel texture update (labels/tags)
- engine instruments needles done at 90%
- engine instruments updated (E1/E2 id., xml)
- copilot meshes instruments (still not operational)
- annunciators/caution lights: (Models/Instruments/Cautions/cautions.xml)
  - mains
  - Engines/Master/CYCCTR
  - logic: all done (except for fire caution which needs a featured nasal)
- better texture management (remove some dupli overload)
- all glasses done.

* CONTROLS
- inverters (OH)
- brake (OH)
- fuel: E1/E2: trans/pump/valve - xfeed/intcon (pedestal)
- hydraulics, governors (pedestal) 
- engine starters 1,2 (collectiv)
- altimeter knob(ingh) (console)
- cautions: testLight, alarmReset (console)

* ANIMATION
- Collectiv / Cyclic
- Rudders
- Front doors (with a 'door chime' caution !)

* INSTRUMENTS
- engine: fuel PSI (simulated)
- engine: rotor n1,n2,nr and logic (modelized)
- engine: itt,oil and logic (simulated)
- engine: mast torque (modelized)

* SOUNDS
- alarm
- doors chime
- better sound engine (using new FG2016.3.1 features)

* NASAL/ENGINE MODEL
- bell412.nas completly rewrited from scratch
- electrical system redesigned (event driven, all user triggered, Nasal timer() thread removed)
- engine system re-designed
- warning system monitoring

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21/11/16 -- v0.3 (R33)
* FDM
- blade Chord optimized to get more stability

* MODEL
- rgba texture removed when not used (far better fps rendering)
- Liveries support with some
- some meshes optimized (limited dissolve)
- Attitude Indicator + Horizon Indicator: better lighting and textures
- Collectiv lighting
- Switches lighting

* INSTRUMENTS
- radioalt DH Knob (desired height) + 'Off' indicator + intelligent alarm
- RPM out of range caution indicator
- OVER TORQUE caution indicator

* ANIMATION
- engine shake animation on ground + option menu to deactivate (don't work well with rembrandt, don't know why)

* SOUNDS
- better sync with engine shutdown

* MISC
- splash screen updated
