The documentation is no more included in the package, you have different ways to get it:
- paid the 2 dollars
- get it for free providing feedbacks:
	- subscribe to my Youtube Channel
	- writing a review of what you think at sourceforge.net
	- at LinkedIn by endorsing my skills.
- it will be always free for poor people or studient/academic.
- other way you think nice for both of us.
Thanks to help me making this project alive.
Have a nice Flightgear.
