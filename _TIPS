* FG Coord System
- Aircraft is oriented on the blender x axis (nose at -x, tail at +x)
- Coords. act like as for Blender, with x negative.
- View position are at:
	/sim/current-view
	blender		FG
	x			z
	y			x
	z			y
	eg: 
		rotor center:
						x 		y		z
			blender  0.0820   0.00179  2.25533
			fg 		 0.00179  2.25533  0.0820
- all objects coord. are like in blender
- some animation/rotate needs to reverse the x (-x) axe.

* Controls / Switches for lighting:
1. the -set.xml set eg. /controls/lighting/switches/beacon property
2. The model design the switch and bind its animation with the property found in aircraft-set.xml eg: control/lighting/switches/beacon
3. the nasal
	- implement a listener on the fdm state
	- init the control/lighting/switches/beacon property to 0
	- create a var beacon
	- create a state beacon-state that change every x secs. following the value above
	- create a timer that update the value
4. aliasing the beacon-state to a multiplay value property in aircraft-set.xml
5. select and animate beacon light texture or object with a condition/property binded to the multiplay value
Attn: object to illuminate must be single sided, and texture at 24b RGB (not RGBA)

* Sounds
- position are in meters, from the 0/0/0 coords. ; see /Docs/README.XMLSOUND
